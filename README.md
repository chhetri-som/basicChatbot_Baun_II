# basicChatbot_Baun_II

This is a continuation of the predictive chatbot Baun. The code was previously built on Tensorflow 1.x. Now it runs comapatible to Tensorflow 2.x (Keras). The chatbot is still a paramedic assistant with medical knowledge.

I have separated the training code and deployment code in two separate files - train_model.py and chatbot.py respectively. 
There is now a basic frontend and backend implemented, which runs on a local host.
HTML and CSS file for the frontend to create a webpage for interaction.
Javascript (inside index.html) and Flask is used in the backend to provide the text responses from the chatbot to the webpage.
The webpage styling is basic.
